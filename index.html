                <h3>My Journey</h3>  
                <p>I consider myself fortunate in that throughout my career I have had wonderful opportunities to learn from truly remarkable people who were willing to give a bit of themselves; their time and knowledge and truly worked to grow and build individuals; empowering them to become the best that they can without judgement, criticism and recrimination and it is those values that I have taken with me along my journey. 
                    I call myself an “experienced IT professional”.  My career started out as a developer (or computer programmer as it was known then) 
                    progressing within the IT department over a period of 10-14 years and was leading (team leader) a group of developers when it was then that 
                    I decided to take a step into something completely different.  I moved over into the world of Systems Analysis and Design, where my focus
                    was on Business Requirements, Business Process Mapping, Functional Specifications and again progressed in my career until I was a 
                    Senior Systems Manager responsible for the management of a number of systems within a large financial institution.  Again, roughly 10-14 years
                    had passed and I made another decision to move away from that role (and country) and returned to IT, initially as a Business Systems Analyst
                    but am currently called a Solutions Delivery manager, managing a team of developers and have been doing this role for the last ten years and I am 
                    now gain finding myself stepping back into the realm of pure development.  So, with that said ..... Welcome to my portfolio page! Here you will 
                    see some examples of my recent projects (assignments really) in, what I can only describe as the start of a new phase in my life.

                <h3>On a personal note</h3>
                <p> When I am not wed to my laptop practicing HTML,CSS, Javascript......    
                    You will find me tinkering around in the kitchen experimenting with cooking ideas/techniques - thank-you MasterChef! 
                    Playing carpet bowls at my local social club or spending the evening enjoying a glass of Moscato with family and friends. 

                    On occasion, I may take out the sewing machine and knitting needles or you will find me reading a good book!  
                    But truth be told haven not done much of that lately.

                        <b> Brief:</b>
                        <p> Using a 3rd party API to collect data, in this case data about the weather for a location you "Search".
                            Save the Searched location for future searches and display the weather details for the current day and also display a 
                            five day weather forecast, highlighting the severity of the UV Index
                        </p>
                        <p> Saved locations are stored in local storage but ony the last ten searches are presented back for another Search.  
                            Built a button to toggle the display of the forecasted weather and ensured that any city that was entered for Searcing was not saved to
                            the top ten Searches again.  The solution makes use of the open-weather-api to source its data.
